# ECS-based RTS on Unity
RTS game example based on Entity Component System in Unity game engine.

Unity version: 2019.4<br>
Using ECS Framework: [LeoECS](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecs) by [Leopotam](mailto:leopotam@gmail.com)

# Purpose of this project
It was hard for me to find big project on GitHub based on ECS. So I decided to create this one and show more complicated game than endless snakes and pac mans. Seriusly, guys, ECS community should stop creating only mobile 1-day prototypes as examples of Entity Component System! :)
